Well Hello there!!

I'm Tejas, you can call me Tej. 

I love to code and would love to master Full Stack Development using Java8, Angular, Spring Boot and MySql.
Plan is to build as many projects as possible and figure out the best way to code things.

My Profile Repo is messed up with all sort of code(s) and notes. Feel free to browse and use code if it meets the requirement.


Goals:
  1. Contribute everyday and make my profile look green. #GoGreen!
  2. Sort Repo so it would be easily accessable.

You can contact me via tej0897@gamil.com

Bye for now!!!
