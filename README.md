Well Hello there!!

I'm Tejas, you can call me Tej. I love to code and would love to master Full Stack Development using Java8, Angular, SpringBoot and MySql.
Plan is to make as many projects as possible and figure out the best way to code things.

My Profile Repo is messed up. 

Goals:
  1. Contribute everyday and make my profile look green. #GoGreen!
  2. Sort Repo so it would be easily accessable.

You can contact me via tej0897@gamil.com

Bye for now!!!
